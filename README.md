# HousePricePrediction
House Price Prediction Using XGBregressor 
üîç House Price Prediction using XGBoost ‚Äì Step-by-Step Process
Problem Definition
Identified the goal of predicting house prices based on various property features using a machine learning model.

Data Collection
Acquired a real estate dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or a public source) containing property features like location, size, number of rooms, and age.

Data Exploration (EDA)
Performed exploratory data analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to understand feature distributions, relationships, and outliers.

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data inconsistencies to ensure a clean dataset.

Feature Engineering
Created or transformed features (e.g., converting categorical variables to numerical, calculating age of house, etc.) to improve model learning.

Data Preprocessing
Scaled numerical features and encoded categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding) as needed.

Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

Model Selection ‚Äì XGBoost Regressor
Chose XGBoost due to its high performance, speed, and ability to handle complex relationships in the data.

Model Training
Trained the XGBoost Regressor on the training data using default and later tuned hyperparameters for better performance.

Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE, and R¬≤ score.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Used GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune parameters like learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators.

Visualization & Interpretation
Visualized feature importance and prediction results to understand how the model makes decisions and which features impact price most.

Testing & Validation
Validated the model on the test set and ensured there was no overfitting or data leakage.

Documentation
Documented the code, process, and findings in a report or README file for clarity and future reference.
